How to Install on an Android Device

1. Download the repository to your local machine with Android Studio. This project was last saved with Android Studio 2.0

3. Import the project into Android Studio.  Click run.


How to Use this App

1. When the App starts you need to enter two numbers in the two inputs. The first input is the nominal size of the thread (inches).  The second input is the thread pitch (threads per inch).
2. As you enter the two values, the table of numbers below will change to indicate the calculated values.
3. There is not submit button.
4. If you want to see what the drawing notes would look like for you specified thread click on the "Thread Note" button at the bottom of the screen. The screen scrolls so you may have to swipe down to the bottom.
5. Once the second screen opens up it will display the drawing notes.
6. If you want to send an email with the information just click on the share icon at the top of the screen.  Then an email App will pop up and you can enter an email address to send to.
